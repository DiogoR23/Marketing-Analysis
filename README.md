# Marketing Analysis
In this project I analysed a bank marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a particular customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

The project started with an Initial Data Analysis (Data Understanding, Data Preprocessing), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

I started with Unsupervised Learning, to check if there are some patterns that I could use, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), T-SNE.

Then I move on to supervised learning, trying to get the best model accuracy.

After all that, I developed an application in which I use the best model given in the supervised analysis, which will make will tell whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit or not.
